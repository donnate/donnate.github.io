<b><i>To start off, a little bit about me:</i></b> I completed my PhD in Statistics in June 2020 at Stanford University, where I was lucky to be supervised by Professor <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html">Susan Holmes</a> and where I had the chance to work with <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/">Prof. Jure Leskovec</a>.
Prior to Stanford, I studied Applied Mathematics and Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique (France), where I received  an M.S and B.S equivalent.

__As of August 2020, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago.__

Research Interests
======
<p align="justify">
My research interests lie in the <b>analysis of patterns and the quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional datasets, and in particular, graphs and networks, geared towards biomedical applications.</b> <br>

Indeed, from brain connectomics to cybersecurity, graphs appear as an indispensable paradigm for studying complex relationships between entities. 
Yet, this formalism deviates from its traditional Euclidean counterpart in two essential ways: <b><i>(1) Data points are connected and can therefore no longer be considered as independent.</i></b> Rather, inference on graphs should be guided by their topological structure and leverage relevant edge, node and neighbourhood information; <b><i>(2) Graph data is irregular:</i></b>  there exists no natural ordering of the nodes, no reference point, nor homogeneity in nodes’ topological roles (degree distribution, betweenness centrality, etc.). These properties imply that graph data is not amenable to analysis through standard Machine Learning (ML) and Statistics methods — and consequently offers a challenging canvas for the re-adaptation of these methods to the graph setting. <br>
<br>



In this context, from the methods perspective, the current research directions that my group is currently investigating include:

<li> <b> Graph Neural Networks. </b> As the direct extension of the deep neural network machinery to graph data, GNNs have recently gained an important amount of traction in the community.  Yet, despite GNNs’ success on reference datasets in the academic community, both their properties and limitations remain ill-understood. Motivated by the necessity to shift GNNs from a “black-box” model to an actionable ML method that can be explained, trusted and relied upon in practical settings, we currently focus on the analysis, improvement of GNNs and graph algorithms at large, as well as their practical application. <br> <a href="https://donnate.github.io/projects/#gnns"> Find out more about our GNN research. </a></li>

<li><b> Heterogeneity in models: </b> Another (related) direction of research that I have began investigating consists in assessing the impact of heterogeneity in models: how do models behave if we account for the lack of exchangeability between agents and allow for some heterogeneity? One practical application of this project consists in evaluating COVID-19 models.</li>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/bayes_covid.png" alt="drawing" width="130" style="float: left; margin-right: 1.5em;"/>
<li><b> Latent Variable Models and Variational Inference: </b> I am also extremely interested in Bayesian and Probabilistic Graphical models (PGMs). More specifically, I am interested in topics ranging from PGM inference  and variational inference. </li>
</ul>

From the applications perspective, I am extremely interested in the potential of graphs and probabilistic models to biomedical problems.
