__*To start off, a little bit about me:*__ I completed my PhD in Statistics in June 2020 in Stanford University, where I was lucky to be supervised by Professor <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html">Susan Holmes</a> and where I had the chance to work with <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/">Prof. Jure Leskovec</a> .
Prior to Stanford, I studied Applied Mathematics and Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique (France), where I received  my B.S and M.S.


__As of August 2020, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago.__

Research Interests
======

My research interests lie in the __analysis of patterns and quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional datasets, and in particular, graphs and networks, geared towards biomedical applications.__
Indeed, from brain connectomics to cybersecurity, graphs appear as an indispensable paradigm for studying complex relationships between entities in a number of applications.
 However, graphs are non-Euclidean objects, for which there exists no standard statistical notion of mean, variance, etc. The definition of a <b>principled framework for doing Statistics and Machine Learning on graphs</b> is thus an active, open area of research. 




From the methods perspective, the current research directions that I am currently investigating include:
<ul>
<li> <b>Graph Neural Networks. </b> As the direct extension of the deep neural network machinery to graph data, GNNs  have recently gained an important amount of traction in the community.  However, this class of methods is not without its share of limitations and shortcomings. Motivated by the necessity to shift GNNs from a “black-box” model to an actionable ML method that can be explained, trusted and relied upon in practical settings, I currently focus on the analysis, improvement of GNNs and spatial algorithms at large, as well as their applications.
.</li>
<li><b> Heterogeneity in models: </b> Another (related) direction of research that I have began investigating consists in assessing the impact of heterogeneity in models: how do models behave if we account for the lack of exchangeability between agents and allow for some heterogeneity? One practical application of this project consists in evaluating COVID-19 models.</li>
<li><b> Latent Variable Models and Variational Inference: </b> I am also extremely interested in Bayesian and Probabilistic Graphical models (PGMs). More specifically, I am interested in topics ranging from PGM inference  and variational inference. </li>
</ul>

From the applications perspective, I am extremely interested in the potential of graphs and probabilistic models to biomedical problems.
