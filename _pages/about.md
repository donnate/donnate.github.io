<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
As of August 2020, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago. 

Contact me directly at cdonnat[at] uchicago.edu for Postdoc opportunities!

I completed my PhD in Statistics in June 2020 in Stanford University, where I was lucky to be supervised by Professor <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html">Susan Holmes</a>.
Prior to Stanford, I studied Applied Mathematics and Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique (France), where I received a Bachelor and Masters of Science.

Research Interests
======
<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
My research interests lie in the <b> analysis of structure and quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional datasets, and in particular, graphs and networks --- particularly geared towards biomedical applications. </b>
</div></p>


<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
From the methods perspective, the current research directions that I am currently investigating include:
<ul>
<li> <b>Graph Neural Networks</b>

.</li>
<li> <b>  Statistics for graphs and networks: </b> From brain connectomics to cybersecurity, graphs appear as an indispensable paradigm for studying complex relationships between entities in a number of applications 
where the analysis of the system at the "atomic" node-level is either intractable or uninformative.
 However, graphs are non-Euclidean objects, for which there exists no standard statistical notion of mean, variance, etc. The definition of a <b>principled framework for doing Statistics and Machine Learning on graphs</b> is thus an active, open area of research.</li>
<li><b> Heterogeneity in models: </b> Another (related) direction of research that I have began investigating consists in assessing the impact of heterogeneity in models: how do models behave if we account for the lack of exchangeability between agents and allow for some heterogeneity? One practical application of this project consists in evaluating COVID-19 models.</li>
<li><b> Latent Variable Models and Variational Inference: </b> I am also extremely interested in Bayesian models, and methods that would allow inference to remain tractable. </li>
</ul>
</div></p>
  
  
 <p> <div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am especially interested in biomedical applications of this topic, and in particular (among others!):
<li><b> Brain connectomics</b> – a developing field in neuroscience
  which strives to understand the functional and anatomical “wiring” of the brain and its association with cognitive processes and psychiatric diseases, </li>
<li><b> Personalized Medice/ Computer Aided Diagnoses,</b></li>
<li><b> Epidemiology </b></li>
</div></p>
