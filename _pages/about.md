A data-driven personal website
======

I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Statistics department at Stanford University. 
I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. Susan Holmes (in Statistics) and co-advised by Prof. Jure Leskovec (Computer Science). 

Prior to Stanford, I studied Applied Mathematics and Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique (France), where I received a Bachelor and Masters of Science.
