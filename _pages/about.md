<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Statistics department at Stanford University. 
I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. Susan Holmes in Statistics. 

Prior to Stanford, I studied Applied Mathematics and Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique (France), where I received a Bachelor and Masters of Science.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie in the <b> analysis of structure in high-dimensional datasets, and in particular, in the analysis of graphs. </b>

 From brain connectomics to cybersecurity, graphs appear as an indispensable paradigm for studying complex relationships between entities in a number of applications where the analysis of the system at the "atomic" node-level is either intractable or uninformative. However, graphs are non-Euclidean objects, for which there exists no standard statistical notion of mean, variance, etc. The definition of a principled framework for doing Machine Learning on graphs is thus an active, open area of research.
