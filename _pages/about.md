<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Statistics department at Stanford University, where I am lucky to be supervised by Prof. Susan Holmes.
 

Prior to Stanford, I studied Applied Mathematics and Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique (France), where I received a Bachelor and Masters of Science.

Research Interests
======
<div style="text-align: justify"> 
My research interests lie in the <b> analysis of structure in high-dimensional datasets, and in particular, in the analysis of graphs. </b>


Indeed, from brain connectomics to cybersecurity, graphs appear as an indispensable paradigm for studying complex relationships between entities in a number of applications 
where the analysis of the system at the "atomic" node-level is either intractable or uninformative.
 However, graphs are non-Euclidean objects, for which there exists no standard statistical notion of mean, variance, etc.
 The definition of a principled framework for doing Statistics and Machine Learning on graphs is thus an active,
  open area of research, which I have began exploring during my PhD.
  
  
  I am especially interested in biomedical applications of this topic, and in particular, in brain connectomics, a developing field in neuroscience
  which strives to understand the functional and anatomical “wiring” of the brain and its association with cognitive processes
and psychiatrical diseases.
