<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
To start off, a little bit about me: I completed my PhD in Statistics in June 2020 in Stanford University, where I was lucky to be supervised by Professor <a href="https://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/susan_person.html">Susan Holmes</a>.
Prior to Stanford, I studied Applied Mathematics and Engineering at Ecole Polytechnique (France), where I received a Bachelor and Masters of Science. I was a visiting scholar in the Vision Lab at Johns Hopkins for 5 months in the summer 2015, supervised by Professor Rene Vidal. I was an AI Research fellow at Hudson River Trading in the summer 2019, and I was lucky to have the opportunity to intern at Facebook  Core Data Science and G-Research during my PhD.

<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
As of August 2020, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the University of Chicago.

__NEWS:  The group is recruiting!__ Find out about [our research](https://donnate.github.io/projects/) and [research opportunities](https://donnate.github.io/openings/). 
We have openings on a rolling basis for postdocs, rotation PhD students (already accepted to UChicago), and a limited number of MS or advanced undergraduate students.
* If you would like to be a postdoctoral fellow in the group, please send me an email at cdonnat [at] uchicago.edu  including your interests and CV. 
* If you are a UChicago PhD student interested in joining the group, please send me an email including your interests, CV, and transcript. 

For others not currently at the University, we apologize if we may not have the bandwidth to respond.

Research Interests
======
<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
My research interests lie in the <b> analysis of patterns and quantification of uncertainty in high-dimensional datasets, and in particular, graphs and networks, geared towards biomedical applications. </b>
</div></p>


<p><div style="text-align: justify"> 
From the methods perspective, the current research directions that I am currently investigating include:
<ul>
<li> <b>Graph Neural Networks. </b> As the direct extension of the deep neural network machinery to graph data, GNNs  have gained an important amount of traction in the community.  We focus on studying their 
.</li>
<li> <b>  Statistics for graphs and networks: </b> From brain connectomics to cybersecurity, graphs appear as an indispensable paradigm for studying complex relationships between entities in a number of applications 
where the analysis of the system at the "atomic" node-level is either intractable or uninformative.
 However, graphs are non-Euclidean objects, for which there exists no standard statistical notion of mean, variance, etc. The definition of a <b>principled framework for doing Statistics and Machine Learning on graphs</b> is thus an active, open area of research.</li>
<li><b> Heterogeneity in models: </b> Another (related) direction of research that I have began investigating consists in assessing the impact of heterogeneity in models: how do models behave if we account for the lack of exchangeability between agents and allow for some heterogeneity? One practical application of this project consists in evaluating COVID-19 models.</li>
<li><b> Latent Variable Models and Variational Inference: </b> I am also extremely interested in Bayesian models, and methods that would allow inference to remain tractable. </li>
</ul>
