<h2> Statistics and Graph Neural Networks </h2>


As a direct adaptation of the deep neural network machinery to graph data, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs --- Hamilton et al. (2017); Kipf & Welling (2016)) have recently gained considerable traction in the machine learning community.  Heralded as the breakthrough for machine learning on graphs that would allow the same “AI renaissance” Battaglia et al. (2018) that standard neural networks have brought to Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, GNNs have been suggestedas  a  panacea  for  a  wide  number  of  tasks  across  disciplines,  including  molecular  design, traffic prediction, and machine learning for knowledge graphs or recommender systems.   Of note is their promising application to biological networks (Li et al. (2021)) — a rich and rapidly expanding body of literature, largely due these networks’ ver-satility in describing systems of various interacting elements.
