excerpt: '							 One of the stepping stones for <em> understanding and characterizing network structures </em>consists in the <b><em>representation and detection of
structural similarities </em></b>– that is, nodes sharing similar ”roles” in the network while residing in different parts of the graphs. However, this is a challenging unsupervised learning task, which usually requires the enumeration and hand-tailoring of graph topological features deemed relevant for the task by the data analyst. </p>

 <p> To circumvent this problem, we propose <b>GraphWave</b>, a method based on Spectral Heat Wavelet for detecting structural similarities. Similar to sonar detection, <b>GraphWave</b> probes the network by diffusing heat wavelets 
and embeds each node's resulting heatprint in vector-valued structural signature. This has exhibited competitive results with
respect to state-of-the art methods, highlighting the incredible potential of spectral wavelets as tools for characterizing
topology and shapes on graphs. </p>'
