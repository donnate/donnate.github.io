permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'One of the stepping stones for <em> understanding and characterizing network structures consists in the <b>representation and detection of
structural similarities </b>– that is, nodes sharing similar ”roles” in the network while residing in different parts of the graphs. However, this is a challenging unsupervised learning task, which usually requires the enumeration and hand-tailoring of graph topological features deemed relevant for the task by the data analyst.

To circumvent this problem, we propose <b>GraphWave</b>, a method based on Spectral Heat Wavelet for detecting structural similarities. Similar to sonar detection, <b>GraphWave</b> probes the network by diffusing heat wavelets and embeds each node's resulting heatprint in vector-valued structural signature. This has exhibited competitive results with
respect to state-of-the art methods, highlighting the incredible potential of spectral wavelets as tools for characterizing topology and shapes on graphs.'
