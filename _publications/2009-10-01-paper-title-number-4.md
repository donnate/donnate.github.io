excerpt: 'One of the stepping stones for <em> understanding and characterizing network structures consists in the <b>representation and detection of
structural similarities </b>â€“ that is, nodes sharing similar roles in the network while residing in different parts of the graphs. However, this is a challenging unsupervised learning task, which usually requires the enumeration and hand-tailoring of graph topological features deemed relevant for the task by the data analyst.

To circumvent this problem, we propose <b>GraphWave</b>, a method based on Spectral Heat Wavelet for detecting structural similarities. Similar to sonar detection, <b>GraphWave</b> probes the network by diffusing heat wavelets and embeds each node's resulting heatprint in vector-valued structural signature. This has exhibited competitive results with respect to state-of-the art methods, highlighting the incredible potential of spectral wavelets as tools for characterizing topology and shapes on graphs.'

Given data that lies in a union of low-dimensional subspaces, the problem of subspace clustering aims to learn - in an unsupervised manner - the membership of the data to their respective subspaces. State-of-the-art subspace clustering methods typically adopt a two-step procedure, by (a) constructing an affinity measure among data points is constructed, and (b) applying spectral clustering to find the membership of the data to their respective subspaces. However, such methods difficulty scale up to large-scale datasets.

In this work, we propose a divide-and-conquer framework for large-scale subspace clustering, allowing SSC techniques to scale up to datasets of more than 100,000 points. 
We highlighted the performance of our approach on synthetic large-scale datasets with 1,000,000 data points, as well as on the MNIST database, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits.
