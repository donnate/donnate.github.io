excerpt: 'Given data that lies in a union of low-dimensional subspaces, the problem of subspace clustering aims to learn - in an unsupervised manner - the membership of the data to their respective subspaces. State-of-the-art subspace clustering methods typically adopt a two-step procedure, by (a) constructing an affinity measure among data points is constructed, and (b) applying spectral clustering to find the membership of the data to their respective subspaces. However, such methods difficulty scale up to large-scale datasets.
 

We introduce geomstats, a Python package for Riemannian modelization and optimization over manifolds such as hyperspheres, hyperbolic spaces, SPD matrices or Lie groups of transformations. Our contribution is threefold. First, geomstats allows the flexible modeling of many a machine learning problem through an efficient and extensively unit-tested implementations of these manifolds, as well as the set of useful Riemannian metrics, exponential and logarithm maps that we provide. Moreover, the wide choice of loss functions and our implementation of the corresponding gradients allow fast and easy optimization over manifolds. Finally, geomstats is the only package to provide a unified framework for Riemannian geometry, as the operations implemented in geomstats are available with different computing backends (numpy,tensorflow and keras), as well as with a GPU-enabled modeâ€“-thus considerably facilitating the application of Riemannian geometry in machine learning. In this paper, we present geomstats through a review of the utility and advantages of manifolds in machine learning, using the concrete examples that they span to show the efficiency and practicality of their implementation using our package.
