excerpt: 'Graphs have emerged as one of the most powerful frameworks for encapsulating information about evolving interactions or similarities between a set of
agents: in such studies, the data typically consist of a set of graphs tracking the state of a system at different times.
<em>A critical  step in the data analysis process thus lies in the selection of an appropriate distance between networks: how can we devise a metric that is bost robust to small perturbations of the graph structure and sensitive to the properties that make two graphs similar? </em>

In this review, we thus  propose to provide an overview of some of the
existing distances and to introduce a few alternative ones. In particular, we will try to provide ground
ground and principles for choosing an appropriate distance over another, and highlight these
properties on both a real-life microbiome application as well as synthetic examples. Finally, we extend our study to the analysis spatial dynamics, and show the performance of our method on a recipe network.
