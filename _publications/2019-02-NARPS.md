The goal of <a href="https://www.narps.info/">this study</a> is to estimate the variability of neuroscientific results across analysis teams. In particular, fMRI data from n=119 participants was collected on two versions of a mixed gambles task. For the data analysis, research groups versed in fMRI analysis were given the raw data to independently estimate the brain activations according to nine ex ante hypothesized brain regions. The main outcome variable was the number of teams reporting a statistically significant whole-brain corrected result for each hypothesis. In addition, prediction markets were for all hypotheses, providing an estimate of peer beliefs about the results.
