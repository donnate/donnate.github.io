Convex clustering is a recent stable alternative to
hierarchical clustering. It formulates the recovery of progressively
coalescing clusters as a regularized convex problem. While convex
clustering was originally designed for handling Euclidean distances
between data points, in a growing number of applications,
the data is directly characterized by a similarity matrix or
weighted graph. </div></p>

<p><div style="text-align: justify"> In this paper, we extend the robust hierarchical
clustering approach to these broader classes of similarities.
Having defined an appropriate convex objective, the crux of this
adaptation lies in our ability to provide: (a) an efficient recovery
of the regularization path and (b) an empirical demonstration of
the use of our method. We address the first challenge through
a proximal dual algorithm, for which we characterize both the
theoretical efficiency as well as the empirical performance on a set
of experiments. Finally, we highlight the potential of our method
by showing its application to several real-life datasets, thus
providing a natural extension to the current scope of applications
of convex clustering. </div></p>
