title: "Modeling the Heterogeneity in COVID-19's Reproductive Number and its Impact on Predictive Scenarios"

excerpt: 'The correct evaluation of the reproductive number R for COVID-19 —which
characterizes the average number of secondary cases generated by each typical primary case— is central in the quantification of the potential scope of the pandemic
and the selection of an appropriate course of action. In most models, R is modeled as a universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and individuals
— effectively averaging out the inherent variability of the transmission process due
to varying individual contact rates, population densities, demographics, or temporal factors amongst many. Yet, due to the exponential nature of epidemic growth,
the error due to this simplification can be rapidly amplified and lead to inaccurate
predictions and/or risk evaluation.  In this paper, we propose to study this question through a Bayesian perspective, creating a
bridge between the agent-based and compartmental approaches commonly used in
the literature. After deriving a Bayesian model that captures at scale the heterogeneity of a population and environmental conditions, we simulate the spread of the
epidemic as well as the impact of different social distancing strategies, and highlight
the strong impact of this added variability on the reported results.'

The correct evaluation of the reproductive number R for COVID-19 -- 
which characterizes the average number of secondary cases generated by each typical primary case -- 
is central in the quantification of the potential scope of the pandemic and the selection of an appropriate course of action. 
In most models, R is modeled as a "universal" constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and individuals. Yet, due to the exponential nature of epidemics growth, 
this simplification can lead to inaccurate predictions and/or risk evaluation, thus begging the question: 
how large is the impact of this simplification on predictions and risk estimates? 
How can this variability be percolated in the projections for the pandemics so as to provide a more accurate uncertainty 
quantification? 

In this perspective, instead of considering a single, fixed R,
 we model the reproductive number as a distribution sampled from a simple Bayesian hierarchical model.
